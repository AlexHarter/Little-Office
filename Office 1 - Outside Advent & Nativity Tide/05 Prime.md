# Hymn
**_R_**emember, O creator Lord,  
That in the Virgin's sacred womb  
Thou wast conceived, and of her flesh  
Didst our mortality assume.  
  
Mother of grace, O Mary blest,  
To thee, sweet fount of love, we fly;  
Shield us through life, and take us hence  
To thy dear bosom when we die.  
  
O Jesu, born of Virgin bright,  
Immortal glory be to thee;  
Praise to the Father infinite,  
And Holy Ghost eternally.  
Amen.
