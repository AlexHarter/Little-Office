# Psalms
## Psalm 109
_Ant._ The angel Gabriel was sent * to Mary the Virgin, who was espoused to Joseph. 

The Lord said to my Lord: * Sit Thou at My right hand.  
Until I make Thine enemies * Thy footstool.  
The Lord will send forth the scepter of Thy power out of Sion: * rule Thou in the midst of Thine enemies.  
Thine is the dominion in the day of Thy power, amid brightness of the saints: * from the womb before the day-star have I begotten Thee.  
The Lord hath sworn, and He will not repent: * Thou art a priest forever after the order of Melchisedech.  
The Lord upon Thy right hand: * hath overthrown kings in the day of His wrath.  
He shall judge among the nations; He shall fill the land with the fallen. * He shall crush the heads in the land of many.  
He shall drink of a brook in the way: * therefore shall He lift up His head.  
_℣._ Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost.  
_℟._ As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.  

_Ant._ The angel Gabriel was sent * to Mary the Virgin, who was espoused to Joseph. 
## Psalm 112
_Ant._ Hail, Mary, * full of grace, the Lord is with thee; blessed art thou amongst women, Alleluia. 
 
Praise the Lord, ye servants: * praise ye the name of the Lord.  
_(Bow head.)_ Blessed be the name of the Lord, * from this time forth for evermore.  
From the rising of the sun unto its going down, * the name of the Lord is worthy to be praised.  
The Lord is high above all nations; * and His glory is above the heavens.  
Who is like unto the Lord our God, Who dwelleth on high, *  yet regardeth lowly things in heaven and on earth?  
Who raiseth up the needy from the earth, * and lifteth up the poor out of the dunghill;  
That He may place him with princes, * even with the princes of His people.  
Who maketh the barren woman to dwell in her house, * the joyful mother of children.  
_℣._ Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost.  
_℟._ As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.

## Psalm 121
_Ant._ Fear not, O Mary: * thou hast found grace before the Lord.  Behold, thou shalt conceive and shalt bring forth a Son, Alleluia.  

I was glad at the things that were said unto me: * We will go into the house of the Lord.  
Our feet were standing * within thy courts, O Jerusalem.  
Jerusalem, which is built as a city, * that is compact together.  
For thither the tribes went up, the tribes of the Lord: * an ordinance for Israel, to give thanks to the name of the Lord.  
For there are set up thrones of judgment, * thrones of the house of David.  
Pray ye for the things that are for the peace of Jerusalem; * and plenty be to them that love thee.  
Let peace be in thy stronghold, * and plenty in thy towers.  
For my brethren and my neighbors' sale, * I spake peace concerning thee.  
For the sake of the house of the Lord our God, * I have sought good things for thee.  
_℣._ Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost.  
_℟._ As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.  

_Ant._ Fear not, O Mary: * thou hast found grace before the Lord.  Behold, thou shalt conceive and shalt bring forth a Son, Alleluia.  
## Psalm 126
_Ant._ The Lord shall give Him * the throne of David His father, and He shall reign for ever.

Unless the Lord build the house, * they labor in vain that build it.  
Unless the Lord keep the city, * he watcheth in vain that keepeth it.  
In vain do ye rise before the light: * rise not till ye have rested, ye that eat the bread of sorrow.  
When He giveth sleep to h\His beloved, * lo, children are an heritage from the Lord, and the fruit of the womb a reward.  
Like as arrows in the hand of the mighty, * so are the children of the outcast.
Blessed is the man desire is satisfied with them: * he shall not be confounded when he speaketh with his enemies in the gate.  
_℣._ Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost.  
_℟._ As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.  

_Ant._ The Lord shall give Him the throne of David His father, and He shall reign for ever.
## Psalm 147
_Ant._ Behold the handmaid of the Lord, * be it unto me according to thy word.

Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem: * praise thy God, O Sion. 
For He hath strengthened the bars of thy gates * He hath blessed thy children within thee.  
Who makerth thy borders peaceful, * and filleth thee with the fat of corn.  
Who sendeth forth His decree upon earth: * very swiftly runneth His word..  
Who giveth snow like wool: * He scattereth mist like ashes.  
He sendeth forth His ice like morsels: * who shall stand before the face of His cold?  
He sendeth forth His word and melteth them; * His wind bloweth, and the waters flow.  
Who declareth His word unto Jacob: * His justice and judgments to Israel.  
He hath not done so to every nation; * nor hath He shown them His judgments.  
_℣._ Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost.  
_℟._ As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.  

_Ant._ Behold the handmaid of the Lord, be it unto me according to thy word.

# Hymn & Versicle
Ave, star of ocean,  
Child divine who barest,  
Mother, ever-Virgin,  
Heaven's portal fairest.  
  
Taking that sweet Ave  
Erst by Gabriel spoken,  
Eva's name reversing,  
Be of peace the token.  
  
Break the sinners' fetters,  
Light to blind restoring,  
All our ills dispelling,  
Every boon imploring.  
  
Show thyself a mother  
In thy supplication;  
He will hear who chose thee  
At his incarnation.  
  
Maid all maids excelling,  
Passing meek and lowly,  
Win for sinners pardon,  
Make us chaste and holy.  
  
As we onward journey  
Aid our weak endeavour,  
Till we gaze on Jesus  
And rejoice forever.  
  
Father, Son, and Spirit,  
Three in One confessing,  
Give we equal glory  
Equal praise and blessing.  
Amen.  
  
_℣._ Grace is poured on thy lips.  
_℟._ Therefore God hath blessed thee for ever.
# Canticle of Mary
_Ant._ The Holy Ghost * shall come upon thee, Mary; fear not, thou shalt hold within thy womb the Son of God, Alleluia.  

_Luke 1:46-55_  
My soul ✠ * doth magnify the Lord.  
And my spirit hath rejoiced * in God my Saviour.  
For He hath regarded the lowliness of His handmaid; * for behold from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.  
For He that is mighty hath done great things unto me; * and holy is His name.  
And His mercy is from generation to generations * unto them that fear Him.  
He hath showed strength with His arm: * He hath scattered the proud in the conceit of their heart.  
He hath put down the mighty from their seat, * and hath exalted the humble.  
He hath filled the hungry with good things; * and the rich He hath sent empty away.  
He hath upholden His servant Israel, * being mindful of His mercy:  
As he spake unto our fathers, * unto Abraham and to his seed for ever.  
_℣._ Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost.  
_℟._ As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.
