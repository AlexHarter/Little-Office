Remember, O creator Lord, *
That in the Virgin's sacred womb  
Thou wast conceived, and of her flesh  
Didst our mortality assume.  
  
Mother of grace, O Mary blest,  
To thee, sweet fount of love, we fly;
Shield us through life, and take us hence  
To thy dear bosom when we die.  
  
O Jesu, born of Virgin bright,  
Immortal glory be to thee;  
Praise to the Father infinite,  
And Holy Ghost eternally.  
Amen.
* Psalms
O admirabile commercium.

/Ant. VIf./ O wondrous interchange! * the Creator of mankind, taking upon him a living body, vouchsafed to be born of a pure Virgin: and by his Humanity, which was begotten in no earthly wise, hath made us partakers of his Divinity.

/Psalm 53 - Deus in nomine tuo salvum me fac/
53:3 Save me, O God, by thy name, * and judge me in thy strength.
53:4 O God, hear my prayer: * give ear to the words of my mouth.  
53:5 For strangers have risen up against me; and the mighty have sought after my soul: * and they have not set God before their eyes.  
53:6 For behold God is my helper: * and the Lord is the protector of my soul.  
53:7 Turn back the evils upon my enemies; * and cut them off in thy truth.  
53:8 I will freely sacrifice to thee, * and will give praise, O God, to thy name: because it is good:  
53:9 For thou hast delivered me out of all trouble: * and my eye hath looked down upon my enemies.
/℣./ Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost.
/℟./ As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.

/Psalm 84/
84:2 Lord, thou hast blessed thy land: * thou hast turned away the captivity of Jacob.  
84:3 Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people: * thou hast covered all their sins.  
84:4 Thou hast mitigated all thy anger: * thou hast turned away from the wrath of thy indignation.  
84:5 Convert us, O God our saviour: * and turn off thy anger from us.  
84:6 Wilt thou be angry with us for ever: * or wilt thou extend thy wrath from generation to generation?  
84:7 Thou wilt turn, O God, and bring us to life: * and thy people shall rejoice in thee.  
84:8 Shew us, O Lord, thy mercy; * and grant us thy salvation.  
84:9 I will hear what the Lord God will speak in me: * for he will speak peace  
84:9 And unto his saints: * and unto them that are converted to the heart.  
84:10 Surely his salvation is near to them that fear him: * that glory may dwell in our land.  
84:11 Mercy and truth have met each other: * justice and peace have kissed.  
84:12 Truth is sprung out of the earth: * and justice hath looked down from heaven.  
84:13 For the Lord will give goodness: * and our earth shall yield her fruit.  
84:14 Justice shall walk before him: * and shall set his steps in the way.  
/℣./ Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost.
/℟./ As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.

116:1 Praise the Lord, all ye nations: * praise him, all ye people.  
116:2 For his mercy is confirmed upon us: * and the truth of the Lord remaineth for ever.  
/℣./ Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost.
/℟./ As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.
  
/Ant./ O wondrous interchange! the Creator of mankind, taking upon him a living body, vouchsafed to be born of a pure Virgin: and by his Humanity, which was begotten in no earthly wise, hath made us partakers of his Divinity.
