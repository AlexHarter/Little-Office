# Psalms
## Psalm 128
_Toni in directum_
Often have they fought against me from my youth; * let Israel now say.  
Often have they fought against me from my youth; * but they could not prevail against me.  
The wicked have wrought upon my back: * they have prolonged their iniquity.  
The just Lord hath hewn asunder the necks of sinners: * let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Sion.  
Let them be as grass of the housetops, * which withereth before it be plucked up.
Wherewith the mower filleth not his hand; * nor he that gathereth sheaves, his bosom.  
And they that pass by say not: The blessing of the Lord be upon you: * we have bless you in the name of the Lord.  
_℣._ Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost.  
_℟._ As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.
## Psalm 129
Out of the depths I have cried unto thee, O Lord. * Lord, hear my voice.  
O, let Thine ears be attentive * to the voice of my supplication.  
If Thou, O Lord, wilt observe iniquities, * Lord, who shall stand it?  
For with Thee there is merciful forgiveness; * and by reason of Thy law I have waited for Thee, O Lord.  
My soul hath relied on His word. * My soul hath hoped in the Lord.  
From the morning watch even until night, * let Israel hope in the Lord.  
For with the Lord there is mercy, * and with Him plentiful redemption.  
And He shall redeem Israel * from all his iniquities.  
_℣._ Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost.  
_℟._ As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.
## Psalm 130
O Lord, my heart is not lifted up; * nor are mine eyes lofty. 
Neither do I walk in great matters, * nor in things too wonderful for me.  
If I have not been humbly minded, * but have lifted up my soul,  
As a child that is weaned upon his mother's breast, * so let my reward be in my soul.  
Let Israel hope in the Lord, * from this time forth for evermore.  
_℣._ Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost.  
_℟._ As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.
# Hymn
Remember, O creator Lord, \* 
That in the Virgin's sacred womb  
Thou wast conceived, and of her flesh  
Didst our mortality assume.  
  
Mother of grace! O Mary blest!  
To thee, sweet fount of love, we fly;  
Shield us through life, and take us hence  
To thy dear bosom when we die.  
  
O Jesu! born of Virgin bright,  
Immortal glory be to Thee;  
Praise to the Father infinite,  
And Holy Ghost eternally.  
Amen.

# Final Antiphon of the Blessed Virgin Mary
Mother of Christ! hear thou thy people's cry. 
Star of the deep, and portal of the sky!  
Mother of Him Who thee from nothing made.  
Sinking we strive and call to thee for aid:  
O, by that joy which Gabriel brought to thee,  
Pure Virgin first and last, look on our misery.

Through the same Christ our Lord. Amen.
